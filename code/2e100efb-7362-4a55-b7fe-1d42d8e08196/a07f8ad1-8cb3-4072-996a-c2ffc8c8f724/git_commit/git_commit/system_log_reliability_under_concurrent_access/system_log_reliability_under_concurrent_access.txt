    "objective": "Validate that the Audit Management System reliably provides system logs for monitoring and tracking activities, ensuring log availability and integrity under concurrent access conditions.",
    "description": "This scenario is designed to verify the reliability of the Audit Management System's system logs feature, as required by the NFR stating that the system should provide logs for monitoring and auditing purposes. The test will simulate multiple concurrent users (representing typical and peak operational loads) attempting to access and retrieve system logs simultaneously. The focus is on ensuring that log data is consistently available, accurate, and not lost or corrupted under concurrent access. \n\nTest Execution Steps:\n1. Prepare the test environment to reflect the production-like setup, ensuring that the Audit Management module and its logging subsystem are fully operational and configured as per deployment standards.\n2. Identify the API endpoints responsible for providing system logs. (Note: The provided API specification does not explicitly list a system log endpoint; if such an endpoint is present in the actual implementation, it should be targeted. Otherwise, this scenario serves as a template for when the endpoint is available.)\n3. Simulate multiple concurrent users (without specifying an exact number, as none is provided in the NFR) accessing the system log retrieval endpoint. Use a representative user load pattern that reflects real-world concurrent access, such as multiple users from different roles (if applicable) attempting to retrieve logs at the same time.\n4. Monitor the system for any failures in log retrieval, data inconsistencies, missing entries, or corruption during the test period.\n5. Validate that all log entries are accessible, complete, and accurate for all users throughout the test duration.\n6. Observe system behavior for any error responses, unexpected delays, or resource exhaustion symptoms (such as high CPU or memory usage) during concurrent access.\n\nLoad Pattern:\n- Employ a load pattern that involves multiple users performing log retrieval operations concurrently, simulating typical and peak usage conditions. The exact user count and ramp-up schedule are not specified in the NFR, so the test should use general concurrent access patterns without inventing specific numbers.\n- The duration of the test should be sufficient to observe system behavior under sustained concurrent access.\n\nAPI Endpoints:\n- Target the system log retrieval endpoint(s) as defined in the Audit Management module. If the endpoint is not present in the provided API specification, coordinate with development to identify the correct endpoint for log access.\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- All system log retrieval requests complete successfully without errors or data loss.\n- Log data is consistent, complete, and accurately reflects system activities during the test period.\n- No unexpected system errors, crashes, or resource exhaustion occur during concurrent log access.\n- The system maintains log availability and integrity throughout the test, supporting reliable monitoring and auditing as required by the NFR.\n\nMonitoring Requirements:\n- Continuously monitor system health, resource utilization (CPU, memory), and error logs during the test.\n- Validate log data integrity by comparing retrieved logs against known system activities.\n\nSpecial Configuration:\n- Ensure that the logging subsystem is configured to retain all relevant log data and is not subject to log rotation or archival during the test window.\n- No specific data preparation or load numbers are required, as none are specified in the NFR.\n\nNote: Since the NFR does not specify explicit SLA targets (such as response times, throughput, or error rates), this scenario focuses on qualitative reliability validation using general performance testing terminology. All steps, load patterns, and success criteria are described using only the information explicitly provided in the NFR and API specification.",
