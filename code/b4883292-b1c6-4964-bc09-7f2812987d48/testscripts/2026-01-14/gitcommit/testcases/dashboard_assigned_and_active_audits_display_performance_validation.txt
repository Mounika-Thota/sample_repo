    "test_scenario": "Dashboard Assigned and Active Audits Display Performance Validation",
    "objective": "Validate that the dashboard displays assigned and active audits to users within the specified performance SLA.",
    "description": "This scenario is designed to test the performance of the dashboard feature that displays assigned and active audits to users, as outlined in NFR-005. The test will focus on verifying that the relevant API endpoints responsible for retrieving audit data respond within the defined SLA of 2 seconds. Test execution steps include: authenticating a user via the /auth/login endpoint, followed by accessing the dashboard functionality that displays assigned and active audits. The specific API endpoint(s) responsible for fetching audit data should be identified based on the dashboard's implementation; however, only endpoints explicitly listed in the provided API specification will be considered. Since the API specification does not detail a dedicated dashboard endpoint, the test will focus on endpoints that may contribute to the dashboard data, such as /clients (GET) for client information, /issues (GET) for audit issues, and /notifications (GET) for alerts related to audits. The load pattern will simulate multiple concurrent users accessing the dashboard to view assigned and active audits, using a representative user load to mimic real-world usage. The test will be conducted under normal and peak load conditions, with users performing login and dashboard access actions in sequence. Success criteria include: all relevant API responses must be received within the SLA of 2 seconds for each request, with average, P95, and P99 response times not exceeding the 2-second threshold; error rates must be monitored and should not exceed acceptable levels (as defined by system defaults, since no explicit error rate is provided); and resource utilization (CPU, memory) should be observed to ensure stable system performance, although no specific limits are stated in the NFR. Infrastructure setup requires access to the production-like environment as described in the API specification, with necessary test data prepared to ensure assigned and active audits are present for the test users. Monitoring requirements include tracking API response times, error rates, and system resource usage during the test. No special configuration or data volumes are specified in the NFR, so the test will use available representative data. The scenario will be considered successful if all API responses related to dashboard display of assigned and active audits meet the 2-second SLA under the defined load conditions.",
